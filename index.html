  <h2>About Myself:</h2>
  <p class="aboutme">Hi there, my name is <span class="name">Sylvja</span> and I have a true passion for traveling around the world. Through my travels I have been able to learn a number of languages and aspirations I have for my life. Currently, i am enrolled at Epicodus which is a coding bootcamp, I chose to attend a coding bootcamp because I strive to continuosly learn new skills that could benefit me in life. I find coding to be an important skill because it allows you to understand the dynamic language used to design websites and apps you view in everyday life. My current goal is to pass the Epicodus bootcamp couse to be able work within the tech field and help friends by desiging their personal websites. </p>

  <h4>My Background:</h4>
<div class= "subheader">
  <p>Educational Background</p>
</div>
  <li> My university years were spent reaserching at  <a href ="https://www.evergreen.edu/"><span class="college">The Evergreen State College</a></span> in Olympia, Washington. I spent four years conducting indepedent projects on the topic of: G  ender and Sexuality through an anthropological and sociological lens. My research allowed me to be extensively in the field by traveling to Brazil, Taiwan, and Europe and referrencing texts written by anthroplogist suchs as: Margaret Mead, Michelle Rosaldo, and Nancy Scheper-Hughes. At a young age I became a fan of Chinese culture, I was 13 when I began my studies of Mandarin-Chinese which led me to getting a minor in Chinese language. I have yet to visit China, it's of course on my travel list. But I did spend a chunk of time in Taipei, Taiwan where I was able to practice my language skills extensively.</li>
